ðŸŽ¬ IMDb Rating Predictor
Welcome to the IMDb Rating Predictor â€“ a machine learning project designed to predict the IMDb ratings of movies based on various attributes such as genre, director, cast, duration, and more. This project demonstrates a full data science workflow, from raw data to interactive prediction.

ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project involves the following steps:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Imported and cleaned a dataset containing movie-related information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships and trends in the dataset using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables, handled missing values, and selected relevant features.

Model Building: Trained a regression model using scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict IMDb ratings.

Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics like RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Deployment: Built a simple Streamlit app for real-time predictions based on user inputs.
